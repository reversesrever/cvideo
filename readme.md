cvideo
======

This is a very simple text-based 2-dimensional video engine.
The way it works could be seen within an object-oriented approach, in which there is a structure that mantains the state of a frame (meant to be mapped in a screen). This frame is then manipulated by the functions provided.

To-Do
=====

Error detection, description and handling can be improved.
Better data structures can be implemented and some boilerplate code can be removed.
